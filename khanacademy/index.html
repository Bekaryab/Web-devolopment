    <h1 id="kangaroos">Kangaroos</h1>

    <p>
      Jump to sections:
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo">Locomotion</a>,
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo">Diet</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae
      (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to
      describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the
      genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo
      and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one
      genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping,
      a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials,
      female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete
      postnatal development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land
      clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the
      Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and
      endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.
    </p>

    <h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>

    <p>
      A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion. Kangaroos are the
      only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The
      comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16
      mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short
      distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2
      km (1.2 mi). This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved
      because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food
      and water, rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it
      employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its
      two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Kangaroos are adept
      swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If
      pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the
      predator underwater so as to drown it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

    <p>
      Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep.
      They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then
      swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have
      different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey
      kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses,
      whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant
      amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also
      consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular,
      usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights
      and mornings moving about and feeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized
      teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its
      molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are
      not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the
      kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars
      move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by
      new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty
      and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.

    <h1>Groupers</h1>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        <span class="first-sentence"
          >Groupers are teleosts (ray-finned fishes), typically having a stout
          body and a large mouth. </span
        >They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100
        kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species
        vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it.
        They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have
        heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat
        fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by
        the largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are
        unconfirmed.

          >Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks
          their prey in from a distance.</span
        >
        They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under
        big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so
        powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they
        feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in.

    <h1>The ocean</h1>

    <div class="info">
      <p>
        The <strong>ocean</strong> is the connected body of salty water that
        covers 70.8% of the Earth's surface. The sea moderates the Earth's
        climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and
        nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since
        prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates
        broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is
        conventionally divided into four or five large sections, such as the
        Pacific, called oceans while smaller sections, such as the
        Mediterranean, are known as seas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Owing to the present state of continental drift, the Northern Hemisphere
        is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about
        2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the
        open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although
        this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large
        rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are
        sodium and chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in
        salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of
        waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level
        produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of
        these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the
        rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).

    <h1>What are clouds?</h1>

    <div id="cloud-sidebar">
      <h5>Why are some clouds yellow?</h5>
      <p>
        Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring through early fall months
        during forest fire season. The yellow color is due to the presence of
        pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of
        nitrogen dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air
        pollution levels.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen
      crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere
      above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also
      known as aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of
      meteorology.
    </p>

    <p>
      Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere
      becoming saturated due to either or both of two processes: cooling of the
      air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will
      fall to the surface.
